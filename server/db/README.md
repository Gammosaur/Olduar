```

### Action type: give

`items` (__array of items__) selection of items that player can get - see properties for each item below

* `id` (__string__) what item will be given (invalid id or empty string means nothing will be given)

    "amount":1,
    "items":[
        {
            "id":"",
            "chance":0.85,
            "msg_party":"%player% tried fishing but came empty handed!",
            "msg_player":"You failed to catch anything!"
        },
        {
            "id":"useless_shoe",
            "chance":0.1,
            "msg_party":"%player% caught a useless shoe!",
            "msg_player":"You caught a useless shoe!"
        },

            "id":"fish",
            "chance":0.5,
            "msg_party":"%player% caught a fish!",
            "msg_player":"You caught a fish!"
        },
        {

            "chance":0.001,
            "msg_party":"%player% caught a goldfish!",
            "msg_player":"You caught a goldfish!"
        }
    ]
}
```
*Please note that declaring `"id":""` means no item will be given. Also note that if you sum `count` of all items it is not 100%, this is completely valid as `chance` is relative against other items in the table*
